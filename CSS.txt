1. Box-Sizing :  there are two properties in this : 

 a. content-box : it will calulate the net width with width + padding +border (default - not recommended - ui layout breaks)
 b. border-box : it gives the actual width i.e the width includes padding , border etc in it (good practice)


2. CSS Positioning :  

 a. Relative : 
    1. the element is positioned relative to its previous position 
    2. Gap is maintained when it is positioned 

 b. Absolute : 
    1. the element is positioned absolute to the closest positioned parent 
    2. Gap is filled 

 c. Static : (dafault)

 d. Fixed : 
   1. the element is positioned according to browser window 
   2. it is fixed at the position throughout the web page 

 e. Sticky : 
   1. the element is positioned but when the parent component is disappeared from the window (like in scroll) then is also gone with that 


3. CSS Size Unit : 
   
 a. px : it is 1/97th of the inch 

 b. em : 
    1. in this padding and margin remains unchanged 
    2. fontsize is calulated acc to parent i.e 1 em = fontsize of parent 
    3. width is calulated according to font size of it's own 

 c. rem : simply is nothing just according to root element font size i.e 1 rem = 16px

 d. vh : height equals to window height 

 e. vw : width equals to window width
